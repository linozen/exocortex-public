## The Goal {#the-goal}

> By "augmenting human intellect" we mean increasing the capability of a man to
> approach a complex problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit his
> particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems. Increased capability in
> this respect is taken to mean a mixture of the following: **more-rapid
> comprehension**, **better comprehension**, **the possibility of gaining a useful degree
> of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex**, **speedier
> solutions**, **better solutions**, and **the possibility of finding solutions to
> problems that before seemed insoluble**. And by "complex situations" we include
> the professional problems of diplomats, executives, social scientists, life
> scientists, physical scientists, attorneys, designers—whether the problem
> situation exists for twenty minutes or twenty years. We do not speak of isolated
> clever tricks that help in particular situations. We refer to a way of life in
> an integrated domain where hunches, cut-and-try, intangibles, and the human
> "feel for a situation" usefully co-exist with powerful concepts, streamlined
> terminology and notation, sophisticated methods, and high-powered electronic
> aids. ([Engelbart 1962](#org5ccc085))
