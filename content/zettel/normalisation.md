## Normality and Normalisation {#normality-and-normalisation}

In its earliest use, the word _normal_ meant "perpendicular; forming a right
angle" like something _normālis_ ("made according to a carpenter's square"). In
Late Latin, however, _normālis_ had come to mean "according to a rule". This is
where the modern English interpretation of the word, established towards the end
of the 19th century, originates from, and what explains the word's usage to
denote social standards. For example, heterosexuality in the early 20th century
was _normal_ ([Harper 2021](#org5c389b4)).

The notion that a thing can be _normal_ is intrinsically tied to the
_technics_[^fn:1] of the modern bureaucratic state. This is reflected in the word
used to describe the discipline in which normality takes centre stage:
Statistics[^fn:2]. It is the field of statistics that assumes that the
characteristics of human bodies, the parameters of its experience or features of
entire populations can be meaningfully measured and compared against each other.
The final aim of this exercise is the construction of an _ideology_[^fn:3] of
_purification_[^fn:4] that classifies human bodies, experience and collectives
into normal and abnormal, governed and not (yet) governed, pure and impure. This
ideology is so deeply entrenched in modern discourse that its removal from the
discourse would render much of it unintelligible and meaningless ([Link 1997](#org249481c)).

In its more general sense _normalisation_ refers to the "processes that construct
experiences and capacities of some social segments into standards against which
all are measured, and some found wanting or deviant" ([Young 2006](#org65a2d81)). In the
discussion of these processes and their modes of operation, Michel Foucault's
work is of paramount importance[^fn:5].

Foucault distinguishes between two types of normalisation. The first being what
he later called _normation_ and the second being _normalisation_ proper. Their
difference lies primarily in their target object. While disciplinary "normation"
as analysed in _Discipline and Punish_[^fn:6] ([Foucault 1975](#org121e9d8)) targets the
individual body, normalisation, on the other hand, as analysed in the lecture
series _Security, Territory & Population_ targets entire populations. Let me
treat each of them in turn:

First, in _Discipline and Punish_, Foucault describes normalising disciplinary
practices or normation as the set of techniques which seek to identify and then
homogenise (with minimal effort) any measurable deviation of bodies from a norm.
The discursive construction of such a norm only becomes possible through close
surveillance of individuals such that their individual characteristics can
become subject to measurement, classification and, finally, correction. Here, it
is important to realise, contrary to popular understanding, that in order to
sustain disciplinary power through normation, the existence of the abnormal or
the deviant is essential in that it renders the processes of bodily normation
meaningful thus justifying its continued operation. In that sense, normation
creates the mechanisms for its own expansion, the natural endpoint of which can
be described as society in which every body and almost everything else is
understood as either being normal or deviant from a norm in some measurable
degree. In that expansion, normation often creates the need to invent new
deviant categories: the homosexual, the person who went _dark_, i.e. seized to
communicate in way that is trivial to surveil, or the person who refuses to wear
a face mask in public. Whenever the pathologization of these categories is
contested, it is important to consider two things in one's appraisal of such a
contestation: The first is the alleviation of human suffering. Obviously, the
assertion of homosexuality as non-deviant has had an unimaginably positive
impact on the lives of many. Quite the opposite is the case when the norm of
wearing of face masks during a global pandemic is contested. Importantly,
however, both of these contestations are similar in one important respect. They
do not challenge normation _per se_, but only quite specific claims about what
exactly is normal and what deviant. In that sense, they remain locked within a
discourse that cannot do without notions like normality and abnormality.

The second form is what Foucault later, more precisely in the third lecture of
the series _Security, Territory & Population_, called normalisation "in the
strict sense" ([Foucault 2009, 63](#org96f6a36)). It differs from disciplinary normation
in that it is applied to populations as whole and not individual bodies.
Foucault uses the governmental response to epidemics in the 18th and 19th
century to explain the divergence of normalisation from the disciplinary
normation discussed above. While in the disciplines, a norm is predefined and
normation then operates to achieve fixed objectives such as how to hold the
rifle and who to have sex with, the operation of normalisation now consists in
"establishing an interplay between these different distributions of normality
and [in] acting to bring the most unfavorable in line with the more favorable"
([Foucault 2009, 63](#org96f6a36)). Imagine different states within a country. Suppose
each of these states has different rates at which people succumb to COVID-19,
thus creating different normalities. Then these different normalities are
compared against each other to construct a temporary norm of what is demmed most
desirable for the overall population. Finally, as Ladelle McWhorter summarises
it succintly in her contribution to the _Cambridge Foucault Lexicon_: "These
population-enhancement techniques do not discipline individual bodies to fixed
norms; rather, by changing the conditions of life of a population, they cause
changes in the norms themselves." ([Lawlor and Nale 2014](#org1cb2321))


## Annotated Bibliography {#annotated-bibliography}

**([Foucault 1975](#org121e9d8))**

In this seminal book, Michel Foucault analyses the transformations in the way
people are looked over and punished in Western European states. Based on
extensive archival research focusing on French writers from the 18th and 19th
century, Foucault tries to understand how punishment morphed from a brutal
spectacle into a measured, scientific enterprise. He opens the book by
contrasting the extreme brutality of the public torture of regicide Damiens in
1757 with the time-tables of a Parisian prison eighty years later. In a
nutshell, the rest of the book is about tracing this gradual but profound
development. Throughout this genealogical exercise, Foucault draws on and further
develops important but often complex notions such as _discourse_, _discipline_,
_panoptic surveillance_ and aforementioned _normalisation_. To this day, the
book continues to have a noticeable impact, especially on newer interdisciplinary
fields such as surveillance studies.

**([Foucault 2009](#org96f6a36))**

This book is derived from Foucault's lectures at the _Collège de France_ in
1977-78. In these lectures, and especially in the fourth lecture, he develops
one of the central themes of this course, namely _gouvernmentality_. Given the
popularity of this concept in the social sciences today, it is fair to say that
this fourth lecture, in which Foucault attempts something like a definition of
gouvernmentality, is one of his most popular and fruitful contributions.
Fundamentally, Foucault revises some of his earlier work (see his update to the
notion of _normalisation_ above), in order to map the development of the
dominant modes of power. First, a transformation from a _society of sovereignty_
to a _society of discipline_ and then to what he calls a "society of discipline
by a society of government [...] which has population as its main target and
apparatuses of security as its essential mechanism" (p. 107f)

**([Link 1997](#org249481c))**

This book is a lesser-known example of how the genealogical approach pioneered
by Foucault can be fruitfully applied to contemporary times. Writing in the
1990s, Jürgen Link attempts to map the territory of what he calls the
"archipelago of the normal" (p. 13). Among the many theoretical contributions of
this volume is the concept of "discourse-carrying categories, which if they were
to be removed, would cause a collapse of the discourse which they carried" (p.
15). Another imporant conceptual contribution is that of the delineation between
_specialised discourse_, _interdiscourse_, _inter-specialised discourse_ and
_everyday discourse_. He defines special discourses as striving towards a
maximum of immanent consistency, the absence of ambiguity and a clear
delineation from other discourses. The usual examples are the scientific
discourses (medicine, biology, geology). Interdiscourses are those discourses
(or elements of discourse, i.e. a certain subset of statements of the discourse)
which play a role across many special specialised discourses and feature heavily
in general, so-called everyday discourses. Link further provides ample reason to
believe that a general notion of normality is such an interdiscursive element
(p. 50ff). Thirdly, inter-specialised discursive elements are those that, like
mathematics, feature in various specialised discourses. Finally, everyday
discourses are the "elementary socio-culture" that exists if it displays
"functional independence" and is not "a pure epiphenomenon of the system of
specialised discourses and interdiscourses" (p. 51). _all translations mine_

[^fn:1]: Here, I am referring specifically to a concept used by Lewis Mumford to refer to the interplay of the social and the and technological or mechanical realms of human innovation. In _Technics and Civilization_, he writes: "To understand the dominating role played by technics in modern civilization, one must explore in detail the preliminary period of ideological and social preparation. Not merely must one explain the existence of the new mechanical instruments: one must explain the culture that was ready to use them and profit by them so extensively." ([Mumford 1934, 4](#orgde6a1ab))
[^fn:2]: It is no accident that the words _state_ to denote a political entity and the word _statistics_ share see same root, see [Foucault 1975, 101](#org121e9d8)
[^fn:3]: By ideology, I do not mean an explicit, conscious attachment to a set of ideas and beliefs. Rather, I refer to ideology here in the classic Marxian way: _Sie wissen es nicht, aber Sie tun es_. For a critique and refinement of that classic Marxian perspective, see [Ziv zek 2008](#org03c089e).
[^fn:4]: On the issue of normalisation as purification and its relationship to what Foucault calls "state racism", see especially _Society Must Be Defended_ where Foucault says: "We see the appearance of a State racism: a racism that society will direct against itself, against its own elements and its own products. This is the internal racism of permanent purification, and it will become [in the early 19th century] one of the basic dimensions of social normalization." ([Foucault 2003](#org6aae2db))
[^fn:5]: It is obvious that the scope of this assignment is unable to capture the breadth and depth of Foucault's thoughts on the issue. Nonetheless, it can provide a useful starting point for further engaging with his writing.
[^fn:6]: In _Discipline and Punish_, Foucault still refers to "normation" as "normalisation" as his refined understanding of the latter was not developed until his lecture series on gouvernmentality in 1975.
