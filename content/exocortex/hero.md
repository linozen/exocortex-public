Hello there, you have found what I call my **Exocortex**. Building on the
work of the awesome people at [org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com) and
[wowchemy](https://www.wowchemy.com), I am able to publish my notes in a
structured manner such that they might become useful to humans who are
working on similar issues.

It is (and will remain indefinitely) work in progress. Some notes might lack any
sophistication. Most of them are incomplete. If that bothers you or you want to
start a conversation on some of the topics covered here, please send me a note
at exocortex@sehn.tech
