## Main Notion {#main-notion}

> Path dependence gains its explanatory power by specifying a particular type of
> causal variable (endogenous) and a particular type of causal mechanism
> (increasing returns) to explain change. Endogeneity is not itself a causal
> variable but an attribute that describes a particular category or type of cause.
> Increasing returns, on the other hand, refers not to a type of variable but to a
> type of causal mechanism ([Rixen and Viola 2015](#org9e51127))
