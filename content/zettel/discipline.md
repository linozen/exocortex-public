## Definition in Foucault {#definition-in-foucault}

> 'Discipline' may be identified neither with an institution nor with an
> apparatus; it is a type of power, a modality for its exercise, comprising a
> whole set of instruments, techniques, procedures, levels of application,
> targets; it is a 'physics' or an 'anatomy' of power, a technology
> ([Foucault 1975, 215](#org85a81ad)).

<!--quoteend-->

> Let us say that discipline is the unitary technique by which the body is reduced
> as a 'political' force at the least cost and maximized as a useful force. The
> growth of a capitalist economy gave rise to the specific modality of
> disciplinary power, whose general formulas, techniques of submitting forces and
> bodies, in short, 'political anatomy', could be operated in the most diverse
> political regimes, apparatuses or institutions ([Foucault 1975, 221](#org85a81ad))
