This is the documentation to my Exocortex. It is a collection of plain-text
files with which I organise my projects and take notes. The note-taking part is
publicly available while the project-managing aspects remain private. This
document might serve as a starting point for others to create a similar system.

## Basic Workflow {#basic-workflow}

My workflow encompasses three phases: **planning**, **executing** and **reviewing**.

### Planning {#planning}

I have three time intervals which are relevant in this stage. Days, Weeks and
Quarters. In practice, this means that I have a long (2h+) planning session
towards the end of each quarter, a shorter (1h) session each week and a brief
moment (max. 15min) every morning and evening to organise my time. The aim in
all this is to decide how I distribute my time across projects.

Simply put, a project is simply a collection of tasks. I also like this
definition from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project):

> A project consists of a concrete and organized effort motivated by a perceived
> opportunity when facing a problem, a need, a desire or a source of discomfort.

Projects are always tagged so that I can quickly filter out the relevant items
for any given work context. For example, I have the tag `fsfe` on all projects
that relate to my [part-time work as a system hacker](https://git.fsfe.org/linus?tab=activity) for the [Free Software
Foundation Europe](https://fsfe.org).

Below the project-level are tasks. Tasks are specific (what needs to be done
exactly?), measurable (what does it mean to be done with the task?), achievable
(is it possible?), relevant (does it matter for the project?), time-related
(when is the deadline or how many hours of what kind of work are needed?). Tasks
can be infinitely nested, but sub-sub-...-tasks don't need to fulfil all these
criteria. Most of time, I use those nested levels for offloading tasks that need
to be done but don't fit within the current task that I am working on. So, I
offload them into the relevant (sub)task to mitigate [context-switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%5Fmultitasking). Tasks
can only have one of two tags: `shallow` or `deep`. This helps me filter before
any given work session. For instance, I might have a two-hour block in front of
me and I am well-rested so that it is possible to work with depth on a day where
I work for the FSFE. I can just query my Exocortex to give me all tasks with
tags `fsfe` and `deep` (obviously tag inheritance across all levels of nesting
is needed here in order for this type of query to be successful).

> By "augmenting human intellect" we mean increasing the capability of a man to

> this respect is taken to mean a mixture of the following: **more-rapid
> comprehension**, **better comprehension**, **the possibility of gaining a useful degree
> of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex**, **speedier
> solutions**, **better solutions**, and **the possibility of finding solutions to
> problems that before seemed insoluble**. And by "complex situations" we include
> the professional problems of diplomats, executives, social scientists, life
> scientists, physical scientists, attorneys, designers—whether the problem
> situation exists for twenty minutes or twenty years. We do not speak of isolated
> clever tricks that help in particular situations. We refer to a way of life in
> an integrated domain where hunches, cut-and-try, intangibles, and the human
> "feel for a situation" usefully co-exist with powerful concepts, streamlined
> terminology and notation, sophisticated methods, and high-powered electronic
> aids. ([Engelbart 1962](#org047282d))
