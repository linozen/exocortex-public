## Origin {#origin}

1970s organizational literature


## (Thick) Definition {#thick--definition}

Institutions as social structures composed of cultural-cognitive, normative, and
regulative elements that provide stability and meaning to social life.


## Focus {#focus}

-   Explaining isomorphism, i.e. the process of different organisations becoming
    more similar over time, and decoupling, i.e. the difference between formal
    policies and actual organizational practices


## Puzzles {#puzzles}

-   Why do organisations become more similar over time (and not necessarily more
    efficient)?
    -   organisations strive for legitimacy. Institutional pressures make
        organisations adopt the "rationalised myths" (design prescriptions) of their
        environments through _coercive_, _mimetic_, and _normative_ pressures.
