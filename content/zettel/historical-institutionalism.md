Historical Institutionalism (HI) developed in response to [Structural
Functionalism]({{< relref "structural-functionalism" >}}) which was wondering about institutional inefficiencies. If, as
assumed, the world was a complex system gravitating towards a steady state, why
did dysfunctional institutions persist. Hence,


## Definition of International Institutions (IIs) {#definition-of-international-institutions--iis}

HI has as an expansive and textured understanding of which institutions matter
and how they matter ([Hall and Taylor 1996, 937](#org8d2dffc)). IIs are humanly devised rule
systems that structure and constrain the behaviour of individual actors.

For historical institutionalists, IIs are:

> the formal or informal procedures, routines, norms and conventions embedded in
> the organizational structure of the polity or political economy. They can range
> from the rules of a constitutional order or the standard operating procedures of
> a bureaucracy to the conventions governing trade union behaviour or bank-firm
> relations. In general, historical institutionalists associate institutions
> with organizations and the rules or conventions promulgated by formal
> organization. ([Hall and Taylor 1996, 938](#org8d2dffc))
