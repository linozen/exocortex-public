## (Thin) Definition {#thin--definition}

Institutions as exogenous constraints on actor’s behaviour, i.e. institutions as
rule systems or incentive structures that regulate behaviour of rational actors.
Functionally, RCI views IIs as a way to **centralise** (and thus streamline) their
efforts on an international scale. Further, IIs provide independence (which
might be useful for "laundering" your position via an independent third party)
and neutrality (possible arbitrator in conflicts).


## Focus (Two sides of the institutional coin) {#focus--two-sides-of-the-institutional-coin}

-   **Emergence/Design** of institutions (institutions as dependent variables);
    institutions as solutions to **solve collective action problems** or **to reduce
    transaction costs**. The assumptions are:
    1.  cooperation voluntary (all actors agree cooperation is beneficial)
    2.  actors are rational (choose options that maximise their utility function)
        and have fixed preferences
-   **Effects** of institutions on political behaviour (institutions as independent
    variables); institutions as a Nash equilibrium - none of the actors can
    unilaterally secure a more beneficial outcome for itself.


## Puzzle {#puzzle}

-   How can one explain the emergence and the effect of IIs given that actors are
    rational and seek to maximise their utility function at all times?


## Core Assumptions of (Neoliberal) Rational Institutionalists {#core-assumptions-of--neoliberal--rational-institutionalists}

-   States are key, yet there are other important actors.
-   World politics is decentralised (not one single world government), yet there
    are institutions with orderly procedures
-   States behave rationally, seeking to maximise their interest
-   States seek to maximise absolute gains through cooperation; cooperation is valued
-   The gravest obstacle to successful cooperation is non-compliance or cheating
    by other states (free-riding)
-   Cooperation is difficult; states shift their resources to institutions if they
    provide states with opportunities to secure their national interests


## Central Concepts {#central-concepts}

-   **Market failures**: institutional deficiencies that inhibit mutually advantageous
    cooperation
-   **Coase Theorem**: The presence of externalities (actors do not bear the full
    cost, or receive the full benefits of their actions) alone does not
    necessarily prevent effective coordination among independent actors. In other
    words, given a set of assumptions, efficient arrangements could be achieved
    even when the rules of liability favoured producers of externalities rather
    than their victims. The theorem only holds if three assumptions are met:
    1.  A legal framework that establishes liability (supported by governmental authority)
    2.  Perfect information
    3.  Zero transaction costs


## Core Argument {#core-argument}

-   Since, in world politics, none of the assumptions hold, the Coase theorem
    needs to be inverted:

    > In the absence of the conditions Coase specified, coordination will often be
    > thwarted by dilemmas of collective action
-   Out of this inversion arise the central functions of regimes/institutions as
    facilitators of international bargaining. With regards to the first two
    conditions, cooperative solutions will be facilitated by institutions trough:
    1.  Establishing mutual expectations about other actors’ patterns of behaviour
        through e.g. property rights. The aim is to create mutually acknowledged
        patterns of legal liability
    2.  Providing low-cost information in a roughly equal way to all parties.

-   From the third condition, zero transaction cost, follows a more complex
    function for institutions because if transaction costs are too high, no
    bargaining will take place, but if they are too low, an infinite series of
    unstable coalitions may form. Hence the function of institutions in this
    regard can be described as follows:
    1.  Altering the relative costs of transaction through issue linkage and the
        provision of a forum (e.g. legitimate bargains become less costly compared
        to illegitimate ones)

-   The creation of international regimes/institutions depends on the individual
    states’ cost-benefit analysis, i.e. regime creation becomes more likely,
    1.  the higher the density of interdependence, and
    2.  the lower the number of actoer, and
    3.  the more the international power distribution approximates hegemony ("one
        state is powerful enough to maintain the essential rules governing
        interstate relations, and willing to do so" ([Keohane 2012](#org5e359a5))
