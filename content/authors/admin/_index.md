I am a system administrator and programmer with a background in
political science, philosophy and economics. I am fascinated by all the ways in
which technology shapes how we think and interact with one another.
I am concerned about technologies of social control and all the material
as well as pyschosocial externalities that result from their global
proliferation.

Currently, I work as a System Administrator for the [FSFE](https://fsfe.org).
Together with a team of passionate free software enthusiasts, I
am in charge of ensuring that our free and self-owned IT infrastructure works as
reliably as possible. Feel free to check out [my
contributions](https://git.fsfe.org/linus?tab=stars) there.

I love generating, organising and sharing knowledge. I don't like if
perfectionism gets in the way of publication, so regard this entire website as
work-in-progress. Feel free to take a look at the public part of my
[extended brain](/exocortex).
