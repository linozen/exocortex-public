I am a Berlin-based international relations student interested in how
information technologies shape political processes.

I just love generating, organising and sharing knowledge. I don't like
if perfectionism gets in the way of publication, so regard this entire
website as work-in-progress.

Currently, I work as a System Hacker for the FSFE, making sure all of their
servers operate smoothly. Feel free to check out [my main
contributions](https://git.fsfe.org/linus?tab=stars) there. Maybe you find
something useful for maintaining your own servers.

To reach out, drop me a line at [hi@sehn.tech](mailto:hi@sehn.tech).
