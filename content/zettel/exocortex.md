This is the documentation to my Exocortex. It is a collection of plain-text
files with which I organise my projects and take notes. The note-taking part is
publicly available while the project-managing aspects remain private. This
document might serve as a starting point for others to create a similar system.

## Basic Workflow {#basic-workflow}

My workflow encompasses three phases: **planning**, **executing** and **reviewing**.

### Planning {#planning}

### Executing {#executing}

### Reviewing {#reviewing}

## Specific Workflows and their relationship to the Exocortex {#specific-workflows-and-their-relationship-to-the-exocortex}

To find out more about my Zettelkasten-inspired note-taking workflow, visit [this
note]({{< relref "note-taking" >}}). There you will find details on my approach to digesting knowledge that I
come across in books, podcasts and other media.

> By "augmenting human intellect" we mean increasing the capability of a man to
> approach a complex problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit his
> particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems. Increased capability in
> this respect is taken to mean a mixture of the following: **more-rapid
> comprehension**, **better comprehension**, **the possibility of gaining a useful degree
> of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex**, **speedier
> solutions**, **better solutions**, and **the possibility of finding solutions to
> problems that before seemed insoluble**. And by "complex situations" we include
> the professional problems of diplomats, executives, social scientists, life
> scientists, physical scientists, attorneys, designers—whether the problem
> situation exists for twenty minutes or twenty years. We do not speak of isolated
> clever tricks that help in particular situations. We refer to a way of life in
> an integrated domain where hunches, cut-and-try, intangibles, and the human
> "feel for a situation" usefully co-exist with powerful concepts, streamlined
> terminology and notation, sophisticated methods, and high-powered electronic
> aids. ([Engelbart 1962](#org76b84e4))
