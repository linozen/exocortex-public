## Summary {#luhrmann2019}


### Two key issues {#two-key-issues}

1.  Contemporary democracies tend towards gradual and legally disguised erosion
    rather than sudden democratic breakdown (e.g. through a coup). While scholars
    agree that this seems to be the case, we lack the tools for properly
    understanding this kind of _gradual change_ (maybe see [Historical Institutionalism]({{< relref "historical-institutionalism" >}}))
2.  There is disagreement about how strong this current wave of autocratization
    is. While some compare it to the 1930s, others suggest the world has become
    more democratic, developed and emancipated than ever before.


### The concept of autocratization {#the-concept-of-autocratization}

_Autocratization_ is a matter of degree and can occur both in democracies and
autocracies. It is _democratization_ in reverse and describes "any move away
from [full] democracy" ([Lührmann and Lindberg 2019, 1099](#orgd9bf005)). It can be decomposed into
the following phases:

### The third wave is real and endangers democracies {#the-third-wave-is-real-and-endangers-democracies}

"Huntington conspicuously identiﬁed three waves of democratization and two waves
of reversals" ([Lührmann and Lindberg 2019, 1102](#orgd9bf005)).

An _autocratization wave_ is defined as "the time period during which the number
of countries undergoing democratization declines while at the same time
autocratization affects more and more countries." ([Lührmann and Lindberg 2019, 1102](#orgd9bf005)).

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2020-05-06_13-12-27_screenshot.png" >}}

A key characteristic of the third wave stands out: Almost all autocratizing
countries are democracies - and not autocracies as during the first two waves.
What is unsettling about this distinction of the current autocratization wave is
that, historically, "very few autocratization episodes starting in democracies
have been stopped short of turning countries into autocracies."
([Lührmann and Lindberg 2019, 1108](#orgd9bf005)).


### The third wave has a legal facade {#the-third-wave-has-a-legal-facade}

While the first and second waves of autocratization were dominated by "classic"
tactics (e.g. _military coup_ <code>[39%]</code>, _foreign invasion_ <code>[29%]</code> and _autogolpes_),
the third wave is chiefly driven by _democratic erosion_ <code>[70%]</code>, i.e. a tactic used by
incumbents where they first access legal power and then gradually, but
substantially, undermine democratic norms _without_ actually abolishing the key
democratic institutions such as the parliament.

### The third wave is gradual {#the-third-wave-is-gradual}

In this third wave of autocratization, the _autocratization rate_, i.e. a
measure of how fast democratic traits decline, is much lower than in previous
waves:
